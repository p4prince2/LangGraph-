# LangGraph-
LangGraph is a powerful framework built on top of LangChain that enables developers to create stateful, multi-agent, and tool-using applications with ease. Unlike traditional pipelines, LangGraph models workflows as graphs, where nodes represent agents/tools and edges represent the flow of information.
